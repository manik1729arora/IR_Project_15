Project Name: Shrimad Bhagvat Gita Information Retrieval Model
This project involves the development of an information retrieval model for Shrimad Bhagvat Gita in six different languages including Hindi, English, Gujarati, Punjabi, Tamil, and Bengali. The project uses two popular retrieval models, BM25 and TF-IDF, for implementing the retrieval system.

Background and Purpose
Shrimad Bhagvat Gita is one of the most important religious texts in Hinduism. It is written in Sanskrit and has been translated into various languages over the years. The purpose of this project is to develop an information retrieval model that allows users to search for specific verses and phrases from Shrimad Bhagvat Gita in multiple languages.

Retrieval Models Used
This project uses two popular retrieval models, BM25 and TF-IDF, for implementing the retrieval system. Both models are widely used in the field of information retrieval and have been proven to be effective in retrieving relevant documents from a large corpus of text.

Query Preprocessing
Before retrieving the relevant verses from the corpus, the queries are preprocessed using various techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization. This preprocessing step helps in improving the accuracy of the retrieval system by removing irrelevant words and reducing the dimensionality of the query vector.

Implementation
The project is implemented using Python programming language and various open-source libraries such as NLTK, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. The Shrimad Bhagvat Gita corpus is stored in a database and the retrieval system is implemented using SQL queries. The user interface of the system is developed using Flask web framework.

Supported Languages
The retrieval model supports six different languages including Hindi, English, Gujarati, Punjabi, Tamil, and Bengali. The model is trained on a corpus of texts in each language and the retrieval system is optimized for each language separately.

Future Work
In the future, the project can be extended to include more languages and to improve the accuracy of the retrieval system by using more advanced techniques such as deep learning and neural networks.

Conclusion
The Shrimad Bhagvat Gita Information Retrieval Model is a useful tool for anyone who wants to search for specific verses and phrases from Shrimad Bhagvat Gita in multiple languages. The project uses two popular retrieval models, BM25 and TF-IDF, and implements a preprocessing step to improve the accuracy of the retrieval system. The model supports six different languages and is implemented using Python programming language and various open-source libraries.
